# Linux Input Fix
A mod that resolves [MC-12410](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-12410), where shift+2 and shift+6 key combinations do not work on Linux systems.

Currently supports Minecraft 1.8.9 on Legacy Fabric, but may be ported to other versions (prior to 1.13).

Inspired by Forge equivalent [mckeyboardfix](https://github.com/Leo3418/mckeyboardfix)
